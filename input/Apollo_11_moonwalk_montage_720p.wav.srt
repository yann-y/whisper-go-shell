1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Okay.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 I'm as the foot of the ladder, the lamb birthday is our only

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 gift for us in the surface of about 1 or 2 inches.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Although the surface appears to be very, very fine green

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 The ground mist is very fine.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 And then along.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Okay, I'm going to leave that one foot up then.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Both hands down about the fourth wrong up.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 There you go.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I think all of the same.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 But there is a red supply that will read the flag that's on the front

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 landing gear of this lamb.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 There's two hemisphere one showing each of the two

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 hemisphere's earth underneath which is here man from the planet earth for

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 except for it upon the moon.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 July 1969, AP.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 AP came in deep.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I guess you're about the only person around.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 It doesn't have TV coverage of the sea.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 That's right, I don't move any bit.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 How is the quality of the TV?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Oh, it's beautiful Mike, really is.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Okay, that's great. Is the lighting halfway down?

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Yes indeed. They've got the flag up now and you can see the stars

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 and stripes on the left.
